## Astronomical Coordinates

**Declination** (`DEC` or $\delta$) is equivalent to terrestrial
latitude. Points north of the celestial
equator have positive declinations, while those to the south have
negative declinations. The sign is customarily included even if it is
positive. Declination is expressed in degrees [$\,^{\circ}\,$],
arc-minutes [$\,\prime\,$], and arc-seconds [$\,\prime\prime\,$].

1$^{\circ}$ = 60$^{\prime}$ = 3600$^{\prime\prime}$

Example: $\delta$ = +23$^{\circ}$ 52$^{\prime}$ 12.12$^{\prime\prime}$

- The celestial equator has a $\delta = 0^{\circ}$
- The celestial north pole has a $\delta = +90^{\circ}$
- The celestial south pole has a $\delta = -90^{\circ}$
